This was a competitive 24 hour coding competition were we delivered a scalable solution to a Non-Governmental Organisation. In this program, we collaborated with other coders in a team to develop an innovative technological solution for a non-profit organization - Children with Cancer UK.

The mission for Children with Cancer UK is to improve survival rates and the quality of survival in young cancer patients and to find ways to prevent cancer in the future.

## OUR GOAL

The purpose of the web application was to offer the following:

- A platform for supporting children and their loved ones through any related hardship
- Provide an immediate community to interact, socialize and share experiences    
- Signposting valuable information to all user groups
