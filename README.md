## Technologies Used 
<!--The app has been developed using [Koltin](https://kotlinlang.org/) a modern programmer friendly language used mainly for Android Development. It was decided to create the app using Kotlin due to many helper features such as variable interpolation, higher-order functions and null safety. As Kotlin is compiled to JVM byte-code, it is also 100% inter-operable with Java! [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) 3.1.2 was used throughout development.
